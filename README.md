### Fruit Slicer
##### A 2D polygonal fruit slicing game written entirely in Python, based on Fruit Ninja.
##### Features recursive geometric slicing - fruits are sliced where the blade hits them, and fragments can be sliced repeatedly.
# 
### How to run:
##### Clone the repository onto your computer. game.py contains the main program file, run it to run the program. No libraries are required.
#
##### The program is run on cmu_112_graphics:
##### https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/cmu_112_graphics.py
##### The slicing relies on the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping algorithm. Information can be found here:
##### https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sutherland-Hodgman_polygon_clipping#Python
#
### To play:
##### Fruits fly up from the bottom of the screen. Drag your mouse over them to slice and get points. You can slice the fruit multiple times.
# 
### Commands:
##### Press 't' generate more fruits.
